# Build-Powerbuilder
Python project to automate powerbuilder build

## TODO:
1. REALLY automate the process, for now it creates 3 batchs that must be executed to create the EXE and PBD's.
2. You need to create the workspace on TFS first, should be configd on a file or so...
3. Make it also compile complimentary files. images, dlls, ...
